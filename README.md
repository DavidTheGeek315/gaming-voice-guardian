# Scimia

Hi,

Nowadays I dont play games too often, but when I do I get very excited and scream a lot lol; so much that my housemates nicknamed me "scimia" which means monkey, in Italian.
it just measures your microphone and plays an alarm in your headphones when you talk too loud.


Python needed to run the source version or use the .exe version if you prefer
be sure to have a sound.wav file in the same folder of the script

Just download the 2 files and run the script by double clicking on windows

Treshold is typically around 100

Help is welcomed, Im not a professional programmer
